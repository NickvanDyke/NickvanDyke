## Hi, I'm Nick 👋

I'm as tired as you are of embellished AI slop, so I'll keep it short 😄

I like engineering — especially deeply technical or cutting edge. I like a challenge. I like contributing to my community.

_So if you're building something that makes engineers' or humanity's lives measurably better, I'd like to hear about it._

**Open to opportunities**: quality engineering, meaningful projects, collaborative technical teams
