## Hello World 👋

I'm as tired as you are of embellished AI slop, so I'll keep it short 😄

I'm an engineer driven by **deeply technical challenges** and **cutting-edge systems**. I like building tools that measurably improve the lives of other engineers or contribute to the broader well-being of humanity.

_So if you're building something like that, I'd love to hear about it._

I’m currently open to opportunities involving **quality engineering**, **meaningful impact**, and **collaborative technical teams**.
