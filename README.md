### 👋 Hi there

I'm Nick — a Senior Software Engineer focused on developer experience, system design, and human-centered solutions. I value curiosity, compassion, and courage, and I show it by relentlessly experimenting to make people's lives easier.

### 🛠️ Projects I'm currently excited about

- 💬 [wanna](https://wanna.social): Social app to make **spontaneous hangouts** effortless and inclusive.
- 🔎 [ESLint - React - You Might Not Need An Effect](https://github.com/NickvanDyke/eslint-plugin-react-you-might-not-need-an-effect): ESLint plugin to catch unnecessary React useEffect hooks to make your code simpler, faster, and safer. _Borne out of curiosity, refined by community interest._
- ⚙️ [Ride Ratio](https://rideratio.cc/): Webapp to mathematically estimate the distribution of gears you used on a bike ride using speed and cadence data.
- 🔧 [My Neovim config](https://github.com/NickvanDyke/kickstart.nvim): An outlet for my love of efficiency and tinkering!
