### 👋 Hi there

I'm Nick — a Staff Software Engineer focused on developer experience, system design, and human-centered solutions. I love to create environments where developers can move quickly and safely to deliver meaningful products.

Outside the screen, I like to challenge myself through ultra-cycling, chase knowledge, gather friends for game night, and spoil my cats 😺

### 🛠️ Projects I'm currently excited about

- 💬 [wanna](https://wanna.social): Social app to make spontaneous hangouts effortless and inclusive.
- 🔎 [ESLint - React - You Might Not Need An Effect](https://github.com/NickvanDyke/eslint-plugin-react-you-might-not-need-an-effect): ESLint plugin to catch unnecessary React useEffect hooks to make your code simpler, faster, and safer.
- ⚙️ [Ride Ratio](https://rideratio.cc/): Webapp to mathematically estimate the distribution of gears you used on a bike ride from speed and cadence data.
- 🔧 [My Neovim config](https://github.com/NickvanDyke/kickstart.nvim): An outlet for my love of efficiency and tinkering!
