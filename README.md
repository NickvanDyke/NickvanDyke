## Hello, World! 👋

I'm as tired as you are of embellished AI slop, so I'll keep it short 😄

I'm a Staff engineer driven by deeply technical challenges and cutting-edge systems. I like building tools that measurably improve the lives of other engineers or contribute to the broader well-being of humanity. **I believe the best systems empower teams to ship with confidence and move at high velocity without breaking things.**

_So if you're building something like that, I'd love to hear about it._
